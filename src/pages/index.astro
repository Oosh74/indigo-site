              Your business deserves better than cookie-cutter marketing. At
              Indigo, we deliver creative and digital support that fits your
              budget and goals.
            </p>

            <p>
              We start by learning your customers, what’s working, and what’s
              holding you back. Then we build strategies that scale — branding,
              web, SEO, content, social, ads, and print.
            </p>

            <p>
              The difference? We treat your business like our own with honest
              advice, flexible solutions, and a clear focus on ROI.

          <p>
            We started Indigo after seeing too many agencies overpromise,
            underdeliver, and disappear when things got tough. We knew there had
            to be a better way.
          </p>
          <p>
            Since then, we've helped hundreds of companies across the USA from
            small businesses to established nationwide brands, all looking for a
            partner who listens.
