        <h2>Digital marketing professionals rooted in integrity</h2>
        <p>
          Anthony Parenti founded Indigo Business Solutions in 2006 after seeing
          too many agencies overpromise and underdeliver. What started as a
          small radio advertising company evolved into a full-service digital
          marketing agency serving businesses of all sizes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Most growth has come from referrals and long-term clients. Marketing
          tools change constantly, but our approach stays the same:
          relationships before revenue and honest work every time.
