## A Website Should be Easy to Use

The first thing you need to consider when designing your website is how easy it is to use. Your website should be easy to navigate and contain all the information that your potential customers are looking for. If your website is difficult to use, you will likely lose visitors and potential customers.

## Responsive Design

As of 2022, over 50% of all website traffic is through mobile platforms. This means that if your website is not responsive, you are likely losing out on a large portion of website visitors. A responsive website design automatically adjusts the website layout to fit the device that it is being viewed on, whether it be a desktop computer, tablet, or smartphone. This ensures that all website visitors have a positive experience on your website no matter how they choose to visit.

## Original Personalized Images

Potential customers relate better to personalized content that provides an accurate image of a company. Avoid using generic or low-quality stock photos that may appear on multiple sites your visitors may have already seen. Instead, take the time to hire a professional to take quality photos that best represent your company and products. Creative imagery on a site can make a world of difference when visitors shop around.

## Utilize Color Throughout Your Site

The colors used on a website can have a major impact on your audience’s experience. Different colors can create different emotions, so it’s important to choose hues that accurately represent the feeling you want your website to evoke. For example, blue is often associated with trustworthiness and serenity, making it a good choice for financial or healthcare-related sites. Meanwhile, yellow is associated with happiness and energy, making it a good choice for a website selling children’s products.

Many websites implement something called the 60/30/10 rule throughout their design. The rule is a common practice for high-traffic sites and helps audiences in navigating and understand the content. A website will use its main color choice sixty percent throughout the site followed by a secondary color utilized roughly thirty percent. Then finally, an accent color is used ten percent to highlight important information on the site. The accent color should be contrasting to the two other colors to help your audience subconsciously recognize anything associated with this color is different from the rest of the site.

Web design color options vary based on desired audiences, but these are standard practices. There’s no hard rule that this color should be used over another, but these are fairly safe guidelines for a client or designer to go by to ensure structure on their website.

## Use the Three-Click Rule

There is much debate among professional web developers whether the so-called “3-Click Rule” is a myth or a fact. There’s no arguing, however, that when designing your website, it’s important to keep the user experience in mind. One key element of a good user experience is the ease of navigation. Users should be able to find what they’re looking for without having to click through a bunch of menus, sub-menus and page links to get the information they are looking for. To achieve this, your website should have a clear and intuitive navigation structure. Myth or not: the 3-Click Rule should at the very least be the go-to metaphor for good website navigation.

The bottom line is: If a visitor has difficulty finding what they need, they’ll leave.

Understand that users do not always land on your website’s homepage. The majority of the time they find websites based on a question or need that your site provides the answer to in the form of content. If they can’t find what they need on your website, they’ll go to another website that does.

Make sure your website is designed with the user experience in mind. Use clear and intuitive navigation, and keep the philosophy behing the three-click rule in mind. Your website will be more successful if you do.

## Understand the Importance of the “Above the Fold” space

Back in the day when the printed newspaper was the KING of information, newspapers were sold folded in half to be displayed in a machine. Or they were folded and rolled up so some kid on a bike could toss it into the flower bed of your front yard. On display, that area “above the fold” was considered prime real estate in the marketing world. It was the first thing you saw looking through the glass of the newspaper machine.

In web design, “Above the Fold” means the visible area of a website that can be seen without scrolling and it is every bit as valuable. Because users are more likely to stay on a website if they can see what they’re looking for “Above the Fold,” it’s essential to make sure this space is used effectively. All the engergy, emotion, and mission of your business can be conveyed in that “above the fold” section of your website. It is an excellent place to put things like a Call to Action (a call now button) or an embedded email form to get a quick lead.

## Consider ADA Issues

When designing your website, it’s important to consider ADA (American Disabilities Act) issues such as white space and clutter, text size and contrasting colors, and using alt-text and link titles. By keeping these issues in mind, you can make sure your website is accessible to everyone.

Today’s website creators must consider all design elements and how they affect the content delivery mechanisms used by an audience. Many of the elements we’ve grown accustomed to on the majority of websites are based on ADA compliance. Fonts such as Georgia and other easy-to-read alternatives are chosen based on their design and typically have a font color contrasting with the site’s background.

## Working with a Reputable Web Host That Meets Your Needs

It cannot be stressed enough how choosing the right web host for your site sets the entire tone of the project. If you are working on a website for a large corporation, you will have different needs than if you are working on a website for a small business.

Some questions you may want to consider when choosing your web host include:

- How much traffic do you expect to receive?
- What is your budget?
- What kind of support do you need?
- What are your website’s requirements (e.g. CMS, eCommerce)?

At Indigo Business Solutions, we can help you determine the best web host for your needs and ensure that your website is set up for success.

## Content is King

It almost goes without saying, but early into a website’s implementation, content is one of the most important aspects of a website. New designers and clients tend to consider content as a secondary element, something they’ll eventually get to. This leads to the website struggling to be successful and provide the audience with a purpose to return.

Understanding that a website exists to provide an audience with information is understanding that content is invaluable. If your site is a business that provides a service, you should feature this not only in your navigation, but the links should provide photos, text, and more driving the notion that you’re unquestionably the best option for the services you provide.

The basic practice is to include a description of your business, helpful tips for the targeted audience, and a hero section. The hero section is a very important design element, it’s typically the first thing visitors will see when they visit a website’s home page and should clearly explain to visitors what you offer, why people trust you, the benefits of working with you, and what action they should take next.

The Indigo Business Solutions team is well-versed in content creation and management. We not only ensure the basic content needs are met for your website, but we identify your audience and produce meaningful content that will attract them to your company and the services provided.

## Typography Should be Simple and Clean

Typography is the style and appearance of text on your website. This should always be clear and visually appealing to your visitors. Making sure that your content is easy to read by using a common typeface will help engage your audience.

Typography is more than just choosing which font the majority of content uses on a site, it’s a design element that can be utilized throughout a site to help convey emotion and important messages to the audience. Contrasting Serif, such as Times New Roman, and Sans Serif fonts, such as Montserrat, or implementing Bold lettering can set content apart from the rest to catch an audience’s attention.

## How You Can Improve Your Website

If you’re considering a new website or redesign, keep these factors in mind to create the best user experience possible and give your visitors what they need. Easy navigation, fast loading times, and relevant content are essential for any site wishing to draw traffic and keep users engaged. Creating a well-rounded digital strategy that takes into account all aspects of design is crucial for success in the online arena— Indigo Business Solutions can help get you there.
