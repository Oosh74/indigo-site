## Custom Branded Products for your Business

Time to Start Planning for the Holidays! (Yes, Already!)

## Holiday Gifts

The holidays will be here before you know it… Now is the time (not the first week of December) to start planning any holiday parties and corporate gifts you may want to give out! Begin designing and placing your orders now to ensure availability and delivery!

Please keep production, delivery times and distribution in mind when placing orders. To ensure you are satisfied with your items and receive them in time for your events/gifting it is recommended to place orders no later than early to mid October!

## Holiday Events

Come together and celebrate the most wonderful time of the year with your team! Whether it be lunch or a formal event, we can start the creative process as soon as possible to have a template ready for your holiday invitations, flyers, etc!

If you don’t have the details of your event just yet, we can work together to create a design you’re happy with and then quickly update the information once available.

Contact your account manager to start the process and for more information
