## Online Reputation Management (ORM)

Steps to purchasing/hiring a product/business:

Step 1: Have an interest/need Step 2: Search online or ask for recommendations Step 3: Browse the businesses’ product selection or services Step 4: Check reviews to see other customers’ satisfaction rating

If you let out a sigh after reading step four, this article is for you! At Indigo Business Solutions, we believe positive customer reviews are a crucial part of digital marketing. Without reviews, your company could be missing out on a huge opportunity for growth!

## Online Reviews are Critical

Perhaps you have read a review before purchasing a certain product or service. Or maybe you have even written one of your own. If so, then you understand the impact that reviews can have on potential sales.

Reviews allow the customer to see what others are saying about a product or service without having the luxury of testing the product themselves. That’s why it is imperative to receive HONEST reviews from your customers. We say “honest” because as the business owner, it is essential to know what others are saying about your products and services. This allows you to make the necessary changes or tweaks to ensure positive feedback! Having more positive reviews than the competition, you guessed it, equals more sales than the competition! The ultimate goal is to influence the customers to choose your product or service over a competitor’s.

## Google Uses Reviews to Rank your Website

Did you know? NEARLY NINE OUT OF TEN CONSUMERS READ REVIEWS before making a purchase. 62% of consumers say they will not buy from brands that censor online reviews. 79% of shoppers say they trust online reviews as much as personal recommendations, and Google is the most popular online review platform. Among the many factors that the Google Algorithm looks at to decide your websites’ ranking, 3 of those are Expertise, Authority, and Trust. Getting reviews from real customers sends a strong signal to Google that this is a business that provides high quality services and can be trusted. This gives Google a good reason (in addition to potentially others) to put your business up higher in search rankings when customers are searching for your services/products.

## Don’t just take our word for it, take it from the source; your customers!
