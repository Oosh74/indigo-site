Last week, one of our clients called us in a panic. Their website traffic dropped 18% overnight. No Google penalty. No technical issues. The problem? Their customers stopped Googling and started asking ChatGPT instead.

This isn’t some far-off prediction anymore. 92% of Fortune 500 companies actively use ChatGPT, and 20% of adults in the U.S. use ChatGPT for work-related tasks. Your customers are part of that group. They’re asking AI for recommendations, comparisons, and advice about businesses exactly like yours.

One thing that many people don’t understand is that ChatGPT doesn’t pull information from thin air. It learns from what’s already online about your business. If your website copy is weak, your reviews are buried, and nobody’s mentioning you in industry discussions, you’re invisible to AI. And that means you’re invisible to a growing chunk of your potential customers.

## The shift happened faster than anyone expected

Remember when everyone said voice search would change everything? This is different. Safari web browsing recently decreased for the first time in 22 years, with users switching to AI for answers. Between late October and mid-January 2025, Amazon.com was the most frequently visited domain referred from ChatGPT’s search function, accounting for 9.13% of all traffic.

People aren’t just asking ChatGPT random questions. They’re using it to make buying decisions. “Find me a contractor in Huntington who specializes in kitchen renovations.” “What’s the best digital marketing agency for small businesses on Long Island?” These queries happen thousands of times every day.

Traditional SEO still matters. Google isn’t going anywhere. But if you’re only optimizing for search engines, you’re missing half the game. AI optimization requires a completely different approach.

## What ChatGPT needs to recommend your business

We’ve been testing this with our own clients for six months now. Some basic patterns keep showing up.

First, your website needs to clearly state what you do, where you do it, and who you serve. Sounds obvious, but you’d be surprised how many sites dance around these basics with clever copy that confuses both humans and AI.

Second, third-party mentions matter more than ever. Customer reviews, industry directories, local business listings, social media discussions – ChatGPT weighs all of these when forming recommendations.

Third, specificity beats everything. Generic service pages don’t cut it. ChatGPT favors businesses that explain exactly how they solve specific problems for specific types of customers. “We provide IT services” loses to “We help Long Island medical practices maintain HIPAA compliance while modernizing their patient management systems.”

## Simple steps you can take this week

Start by asking ChatGPT about your own business. Try different variations. “Tell me about [your business name].” “Who’s the best [your service] provider in [your city]?” “Compare [your business] to [your competitor].” Screenshot the responses. That’s your baseline.

Next, audit your website for clarity. Can someone understand what you do, where you operate, and why you’re different within 10 seconds of landing on your homepage? If not, fix that first.

Get your business listed correctly everywhere that matters. Google Business Profile, Yelp, industry directories, local Chamber of Commerce. Make sure your information matches exactly across all platforms. Name, address, phone number, services offered. Consistency helps AI understand you’re a legitimate, established business.

Ask happy customers to mention specific services in their reviews. Instead of “Great company!” you want “They redesigned our website and our leads doubled in three months.” Specific wins give AI concrete examples to reference.

## This is just the beginning

Although this is still to be confirmed, ChatGPT is projected to hold 1% of the search market in 2026. It may sound small, but that’s millions of potential customers choosing AI over Google for business research. By next year, that number will double. Maybe triple.

Smart businesses are preparing now. They’re creating content that answers real questions. Building authentic online presence across multiple platforms. Making sure AI has accurate, compelling information to share about them.

The businesses ignoring this shift? They’ll wonder why their phone stopped ringing while competitors stay busy. Don’t be one of them.

Want to know if your business shows up in ChatGPT searches? Give us a call. We’ll run a quick audit and show you exactly where you stand. It takes about 15 minutes, but might just be the most important 15 minutes for your business this year.
